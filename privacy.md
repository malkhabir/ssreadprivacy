# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 20, 2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how our mobile application ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our AI-powered app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

**We do not record, store, or save any of your personal data on our servers.** Our app operates with a privacy-first approach:

- We do not store your conversations or queries
- We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers
- We do not track your location or device information
- No user accounts or profiles are created

## How We Use Your Information

Since we do not store any personal data, there is no information for us to use, analyze, or process on our end. Your interactions with the app are processed in real-time to provide AI responses and are not retained.

## Data Sharing

**OpenAI Integration:** When you ask questions or make requests to our AI, your queries are sent to OpenAI's servers to generate responses. This is necessary for the app to function. OpenAI has their own privacy policy governing how they handle this data.

We do not share, sell, or trade any personal information with third parties beyond this necessary AI processing. No personal data is stored or shared by us.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
